# RutaKnows User Manual

## Introduction

RutaKnows is a comprehensive jeepney route navigation application designed specifically for the Philippine transportation ecosystem. Developed by **Team HCI World**, this app addresses the significant challenge of navigating the complex and often undocumented network of jeepney routes throughout the Philippines.

### Problem Statement
Jeepneys are the most convenient, common, and affordable modes of public transportation in the Philippines. However, navigating their routes can be extremely challenging for:
- **Tourists** unfamiliar with local transportation
- **New residents** learning the area
- **Daily commuters** seeking more efficient routes
- **Long-time locals** discovering alternative paths

Unlike buses or trains, jeepney routes are rarely available on mainstream navigation platforms like Google Maps, forcing people to rely on trial and error, word of mouth, or expensive alternatives like taxis.

### Our Solution
RutaKnows serves as a centralized, interactive platform that maps out jeepney routes across Philippine cities, transforming chaotic navigation into an organized, user-friendly experience.
